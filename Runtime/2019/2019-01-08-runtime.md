## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion

- [EM] Call for vote to approve Jonathan Sirlin as CF Networking Project Lead
- [EM] Using "alpha" and "beta" instead of "experimental" in descriptions of feature or component maturity?

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

* Working through the feature stories for [`multi-service-registration`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OBnFCsL3ru43PEXocsCc3EuGaM0YLHjr0iAoXnakt4)
* Exploring granular upgrades for single-service instance upgrades - waiting for this [OSBAPI pr](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/pull/628) to be merged so we can move forward with implementation 
* Starting to explore backup and restore of service instances
* We're exploring what it would take for us to move services out of the Cloud Controller


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Current Tracks: 
  - CPU Entitlements: nearing first milestone, works end to end, polishing UX prior to first release for folks to try out as a cli plugin
  - ContainerD: is now default for container create/destroy lifecycle! working on using for process creation/destruction too
  - Rootless Containers: shipped! waiting for feedback but hasn't blown up yet :)
- Next/Planned Tracks:
  - CPU Entitlements milestones 2/3 (reporting of over-entitlement containers, enforcement of entitlements)
  - ContainerD Snapshot Drivers (merging grootfs upstream so we can stop maintaining filesystem stuff and get all the nice community supported filesystem drivers)
  - Rootless + ContainerD: timelines being timelines we now need to rebase the rootless work on top of ContainerD

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

- Core CATs Pass!
- Working on non-functional requirements needed for first production beta releases (MVP Milestone 2)
  - Aim to get a first production beta deployed for people to use this quarter ðŸ¤ž
- Spinning up additional pairs in US, will (provisionally) work on pluggability of opi->k8s yml (to allow parallel pairs without blocking on EU team), docs, and end-to-end-TLS/ssh/container-networking (i.e. the highest priority non-core features).


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing to work on enabling Linux cells to pass droplets and other download references through to Garden/Grootfs
  - Finished opt-in configuration on cell reps to send droplet as image layer to Garden
  - Working with CAPI to resolve Windows case of CC opt-in usage of image layer specification
- Finishing up more generic specification of container metric tags for DesiredLRPs, to distinguish metrics from v3 apps with several processes or during zero-downtime deploys
- Upcoming: making Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Container Networking - Jonathan Sirlin

- Envoy Sidecar Enablement: under the right conditions, traffic now flows through the sidecar Envoy. Still work to do before it's HA
- Istio Scaling: Working closely with other teams to ensure that Istio/Envoy can work at scale. This is a long-running process that will likely impact how teams work together in the future. 
- Dynamic Egress Policies: Now that DEPs are available in Beta, we continue to add functionality and bring parity between DEPs and ASGs so we can make them GA in the future. After achieving parity, we plan to build a tool to migrate ASGs to DEPs, and to then implement CLI functionality
